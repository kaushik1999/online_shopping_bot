The WebChat SDK is a quick and convenient way to embed chat in your website or you can easily frame the chat yourself. Integrating WebChat into a new or existing project takes only a few lines of code

1. Embed the Bot widget on your site.
Embed the folowing code on your website to display a "Bot" button in the lower right of the page

Code:-
                                <link href="https://snatchbot.me/sdk/webchat.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><script src="https://snatchbot.me/sdk/webchat.min.js"></script><script> Init('?botID=12885&appID=McAAOkR848ab3biLXBnt', 600, 600, 'https://dvgpba5hywmpo.cloudfront.net/media/image/1521563810onR7PXhzwj', 'rectangle', '#00AFF0', 90, 90, 62.99999999999999, '0', '0', '#FFFFFF'); /* for authentication of its users, you can define your userID (add &userID={login}) */ </script>
                        
                        
2. Frame the webchat URL anywhere you like.
No need in forcing people to install the right app for just a quick chat. - Simple!

URL:-  
                                https://snatchbot.me/webchat/?botID=12885&appID=McAAOkR848ab3biLXBnt
                            
                            
                            
          You can change how your chat window looks on your page. Feel free to frame your webchat URL as you desire

You may frame the URL on a page or display the frame only when user initiates chat (recommended)

3. Customize your chat window with CSS.
You can spice up your chat window using custom CSS styles

Upload your css file 
After you uploaded the changes to your CSS styles you can check the new look of your chat window on your WebChat URL.
